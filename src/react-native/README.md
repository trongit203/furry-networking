# React Native Version of PetConnect

This directory contains React Native components that can be used to build the native mobile version of the PetConnect app.

## Structure

- `App.tsx`: The entry point for the React Native application
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `ProfileAvatar.tsx`: Avatar component for user profiles
  - `PetCard.tsx`: Card component for displaying pet posts
- `screens/`: Screen components that represent full pages
  - `ExploreScreen.tsx`: The explore feed screen

## Next Steps for Complete Migration

1. Set up a proper React Native project using React Native CLI or Expo
2. Install required dependencies:
   - react-native
   - react-native-vector-icons (for icons)
   - react-navigation (for navigation)
   - react-native-gesture-handler (for gestures)
   - react-native-reanimated (for animations)
   - etc.

3. Copy these components into the new project structure
4. Implement all remaining screens (Home, Create, Marketplace, Profile)
5. Set up proper navigation with react-navigation
6. Implement state management (Context API or Redux)
7. Add proper error handling and loading states
8. Test on Android and iOS devices

## Important Notes

- These components are designed to match the styling and functionality of the web app, but with React Native's component model
- You'll need to replace the IconPlaceholder components with proper icons from react-native-vector-icons
- Image paths will need to be updated to use proper asset management in React Native
